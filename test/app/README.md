A simple express application to demonstrate how the library works.

    $ node index.js # start the app without coverage

    $ node index.js --coverage # start the app with coverage

    $ open http://localhost:8888/coverage # shows coverage info

    $ curl -o coverage.zip http://localhost:8888/coverage/download # gives you the zip file with reports
